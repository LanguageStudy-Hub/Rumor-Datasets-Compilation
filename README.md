# Rumor-Datasets-Compilation
This rumor material dataset is specifically compiled for researchers in the fields of linguistics, communication studies, and computational linguistics. The database covers multiple domains and is sourced from authoritative research databases, including basic information such as communication carriers.
This repository collates and makes the Chinese rumor data available. The data covers all scenarios of Chinese Internet platforms such as WeChat, Weibo, Zhihu, Toutiao, Xiaohongshu, Douyin, and Kuaishou, and encompasses both textual and visual content, as well as short video copywriting. It includes more than thousands upon thousands of rumors which are not retrievable in the current Internet.
The data has undergone standardized processing such as deduplication, noise reduction, and manual verification. It can be used for the training and validation of models in the field of natural language processing for rumor detection, classification, etc.
Data processing procedure:
All the data have undergone strict standardization processing to ensure their validity and accuracy:
1、Collection: Scraping / organizing public health rumor texts from various platforms (all following the public content usage norms of the platforms, without any privacy information);
2、Cleaning: Removing duplicates, deleting meaningless redundant content, correcting text garbled or typos, retaining the core expression of the rumor;
3、Selection: Manual verification, eliminating non-rumors and ambiguous information, confirming that each piece of data is a health rumor that has been debunked by authoritative institutions (Health Commission, science popularization platforms, professional medical institutions).
